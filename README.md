- 👋 Hi, I’m Thien K. M. Bui
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack web development (honestly I just like to program but web dev makes my content more accessible)
- 🌱 I just graduated from Carleton College with a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. I'll be starting at JPMC this summer as a SDE.
- 💞️ I'm interested in building random applications, just reach out!
- 📫 I can be reached at kevinbui904@gmail.com
